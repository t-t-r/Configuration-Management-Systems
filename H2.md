# H2

## Getting started 
As i created a new clean vm for this exercise i needed to start by making the necessary updates. 
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
Next installed lshw to see some information about the system and cheked the os after that
```
$ sudo apt-get install lshw
$ sudo lshw -short -class processor -class memory

memory   128Kib BIOS
memory   4GiB System memory
processor Intel(R) Core(TM) -7-10710U CPU @ 1.10G

$grep '^VERSION' /etc/os-release

VERSION_ID="11"
VERSION="11 (bullseye)"
VERSION_CODENAME=bullseye

```
So, nothing out of the ordinary. Debian bullseye running on 4Gib memory and a reasonable intel CPU. Moving on.

## Installing apache 
### The manual way
Eventhough i knew apache was not installed, still checked it. After confirmed that apache was not installed, installed it. Installed ufw and made a hole for http, activated firewall, started apache and tested if it was running.
```
$ systemctl status apache2

Unit apache2.service could not be found.

$sudo apt-get install apache2  

$sudo apt-get install ufw
$sudo ufw allow http
$sudo ufw enable 
$sudo systemtl start apache2
$curl https://localhost
$curl --head http://localhost
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date . . .
Server: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)
.
.
```
With the curl-command to https, i saw that the firewall was blocking the 443 since i hadn't opened it - hence ufw was working correctly.
Based on a response to curl --head http://localhost i saw that the apache was now working correctly too.

## Next doing the same with salt
Started by installing salt-master and salt-minion. 
```
$sudo apt-get -y install salt-master
$sudo apt-get -y install salt-minion

```
Next created the path to my future salt state, made init.sls file to install apache2 and tested the result
```
$sudo mkdir /srv/salt/apache
$sudo nano /srv/salt/apache/init.sls

apache
  pkg.installed:
    - name: apache2

$sudo salt-call --local state.apply apache
        .
Succeeded: 1
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:       1
Total run time     41.359 ms
```
Next plan was to add ufw to installed packages and punch a hole to ufw via cmd.run. Started out by denying http and diabling ufw for test purposes.
```
$sudo ufw deny http
$sudo ufw status
.
80/TCP                  DENY  
80/TCP  (v6)            DENY
.

$sudo ufw disable
$sudo ufw status

Status: inactive
```
Connections to port 80 are now blocked and the firewall is deactivated. Then went back to init.sls and added the following two parts. First one opens the port for http unless it is already open. The second one enables ufw unless it is already active.
```
ufw allow 80/tcp:
  cmd.run:
    - unless: "ufw status verbose | grep '80/tcp'"
    
 ufw enable:
   cmd.run:
     - unless: "ufw status | grep 'Status: active'"
```
Next ran my apache-state and did the ufw tests again.
```
$sudo salt-call --local state.apply apache
$sudo ufw status
Status: active
.
80/tcp            ALLOW
80/tcp  (v6)      ALLOW
```
