# H2

## Getting started 
As i created a new clean vm for this exercise i needed to start by making the necessary updates. 
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
Next installed lshw to see some information about the system and cheked the os after that
```
$ sudo apt-get install lshw
$ sudo lshw -short -class processor -class memory

memory   128Kib BIOS
memory   4GiB System memory
processor Intel(R) Core(TM) -7-10710U CPU @ 1.10G

$grep '^VERSION' /etc/os-release

VERSION_ID="11"
VERSION="11 (bullseye)"
VERSION_CODENAME=bullseye

```
So, nothing out of the ordinary. Debian bullseye running on 4Gib memory and a reasonable intel CPU. Moving on.

## Installing apache 
### The manual way
Eventhough i knew apache was not installed, still checked it. After confirmed that apache was not installed, installed it. Installed ufw and made a hole for http, activated firewall, started apache and tested if it was running.
```
$ systemctl status apache2

Unit apache2.service could not be found.

$sudo apt-get install apache2  

$sudo apt-get install ufw
$sudo ufw allow http
$sudo ufw enable 
$sudo systemtl start apache2
$curl https://localhost
$curl --head http://localhost
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date . . .
Server: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)
.
.
```
With the curl-command to https, i saw that the firewall was blocking the 443 since i hadn't opened it - hence ufw was working correctly.
Based on a response to curl --head http://localhost i saw that the apache was now working correctly too.

## Next doing the same with salt
Started by installing salt-master and salt-minion. Checked the results with ls.
```
$sudo apt-get -y install salt-master
$sudo apt-get -y install salt-minion

$ls -l /etc/salt
master  master.d  minion  minion.d
```

```
